# SkillFactory_FPW2.0_B

Tic-tac-toe game.

The standard library Python 3.9.2 was used.

The game offers two modes:
1) multyplayer (for two players)
2) a game with a computer

The logic of computer moves is very primitive, but by chance even he can win =)
The logic is implemented in a separate function that can be improved if desired.

You can run the file through the console using the standard method.
